## Release v1.3.0

- Added the 'Interpreter Menu'.
    - F5 to start debug
    - F6 to run
    - If debugging and paused; F2 to step
- Added breakpoint support
    - Click on the area next to the line number to set a breakpoint
    - Once the code hits that point, it will pause
    - Known issues:
        - Not all lines will cause a break (e.g. `repeat`)
        - The statement will evaluate before pausing
