Started using [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) and [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to automatically build and test. I had been hesitant before to start testing simply because most of the code was GUI oriented and I didn't know how to test. However, I went with the coveralls approach to make sure that every line (or for now 34% of my code) is executed. Actually using junit to check for expected values however is not done in most cases right now.

Of course, this led directly to locating some lines of code that should have been executed, but weren't!

So small release to fix this, and now a target to start getting more code coverage.

Grab it while it's hot!
