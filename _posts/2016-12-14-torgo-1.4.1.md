## Release v1.4.1: Small revision update. Big Feature Update!  

In honor if Nine Inch Nails releasing Not The Actual Events; a new release for Torgo!

### Fixes
- Stack and Variable view windows cannot be closed now.  They will disappear once the script has completed.

### Updates
- Update to the GUI to use [DockingFrames](https://github.com/Benoker/DockingFrames).

Now the components can be dragged around and positioned where desired.  Layouts are saved so you don't have to worry about changing it each time.

## Download [here][1] or install via snap.

```sh
sudo snap install torgo
```
